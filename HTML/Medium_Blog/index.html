    <h1>Introducing Apex Ping</h1>
    <p>
      I’d like to introduce Apex Ping! A minimalistic, but powerful uptime & performance monitoring service for websites and APIs. In this post I’ll cover features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first, and a few things I learned in the process. In future posts I’ll be detailing the implementation for anyone who is curious.
    </p>

      I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda, with 500 users it has already detected over a million errors, and performed over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters who have checked it out!
