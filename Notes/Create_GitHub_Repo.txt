Create GitHub Repository

Two methods to create a repository:

1. Initiate the repository on the GitHub site
2. Initiate the repository on your local host


To initiate the setup of a Git repository on the GitHub website:

- Navigate to Repositories
- Click the ’New’ button
- Enter repository name and description
- Check the README checkbox
- If the repository is going to be used for a Python project select ‘Python’ in the drop-down box at the bottom of the page
- Click the ‘Create repository’ button
- Click the ‘Clone or download’ button
- Click the ‘Use HTTPS’ text in the drop-down text box
- Click the icon next to the text box with the URL to copy the URL to the clipboard
- On your local, in Terminal, change your working directory to the directory where you want your new directory/repository to be created
- Use the ‘git clone HTTPS://….’ command using the URL copied from GitHub
- Done


To initiate the setup of a Git repository on your local host:

- Create the repository on GitHub without a README
- On your local, set your working directory to where you want your Git repository
- On your local, git init
- On your local, git add README.md (may not be necessary of React, it may create a README for you)
- On your local, git commit -m "first commit"
- Get the link to the GitHub repository using 'SSH' - example 'git@github.com:HarleyGeek/react-hello.git'
- On your local, git remote add origin git@github.com:HarleyGeek/react-hello.git (where 'git@github.com:HarleyGeek/react-hello.git' is the link from the previous step)
- On your local, git push -u origin master
- Done
